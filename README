Reinvented traits
========================

Introduction
------------
The purpose of this library is to provide several type traits userful for
programmers.

Please, note, that this library was intended to be C++0x compliant, not
C++03 or C++98.

Rationale
---------
C++ has a lot of userful type traits, which covers almost all programmers
needs, but there are still couple of them I want to use regulary and in
handy way.

Overview
--------
  * `cheapcopy.hpp` contains definition of two traits:
    * `TIsCheapCopyable` has static const member `Value_` which is true
      for types which are smaller that `void*` and trivially copyable, so,
        they can be passed to functions by value, instead of const reference.
    * `TCheapCopy` defines `TValueType` same as template parameter for cheap
      copyable types and const reference otherwise.

Installation
------------
You require bjam (a.k.a. boost build) to install this package.
In order to launch sanity test you need Boost.Test to be installed.

  * In order to install, execute bjam with argument
    `dist --includedir=<prefix>`, where `<prefix>` is the installation path
    where library will be installed. More precisely, `reinvented-wheels`
    subfolder will be created, containing all required headers.
  * In order to launch the test, execute bjam with `-d0 test` argument and
    ensure that return code was 0.
